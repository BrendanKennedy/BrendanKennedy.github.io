I am a computer science PhD student at the University of Southern California in the [Computational Social Science Lab (CSSL)](https://dornsife.usc.edu/labs/cssl/). My advisor is Dr. Morteza Dehghani. 

I research at intersection of psychology, language, and computer science. My specific areas of research include:

* Applications of natural language processing (NLP) in social psychology and cognitive science
* Development and application of explainable methods in NLP
* Development of text corpora and other language resources for psychology
