This is the first blog post I've created, and honestly I honestly don't know what all I will be writing about. 

Expect a mixture of ramblings, unofficial book/article reviews, coding tutorials, and extensions of my research in blog form.

And if you're lucky, a few well-placed posts on some of my favorite philosophers, chess players, musicians, and athletes.
